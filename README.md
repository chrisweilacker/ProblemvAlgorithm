# Problem.V.Algorithm

## Square Root
Used a binary search type of algorithm to find the Square Root for perfect Squares or floored Square Root for non perfect Squares in O(log n) time with O(1) space complexity. 

## Rotated Array Search
Utilized a pivot search and binary search to find an element in a rotated Array with a worst case of Big O (log n). Space complexity would be O(1) as search is done in place.

## Rearrage Array Digits
Utilized Merge Sort Algorithm to sort a list of digits and combine them into two numbers that would combine to the largest sum.  This mergeSort based algorithm would have an O(n log n) time complexity and a O(n) space complexity.

## Sort 012
Sorted an array with only three possible values in O(n) time and O(n) space complexity with an inplace sort.

## AutoComplete Trie
Built a Trie structure to hold words used to autocomplete words bassed on a prefix that would return all words as a list.  Space complexity is O(n), It was suggested that space coplexity would be O(n*m) where n is the average length of the word and m is every word. I would disagree as given a large enough amount of words alot of words utilize the same letter(s) such as a, an, and and. Although there is an a for all of them that a gets reused and in the case of an and and the an gets reused, we do know that every complete word must have a node but with a lot of reuse I would think O(n) space complexity would be correct here. The time complexity is O(n).

## Get Min and Max
A simple trasversal algorith to find the smallest and largest element utilizing O(n) time and O(1) space.

## Request Routing
Utilizing a Trie structure this class holds the folder structure and handlers(files) associated with a web server.  The algorithm calls have a O(n) time complexity and a O(n) space complexity.
