# Problem.V.Algorithm

## Square Root
Used a binary search type of algorithm to find the Square Root for perfect Squares or floored Square Root for non perfect Squares in O(log n) time with O(1) space complexity. 

## Rotated Array Search
Utilized a pivot search and binary search to find an element in a rotated Array with a worst case of Big O (log n). Space complexity would be O(1) as search is done in place.

## Rearrage Array Digits
Utilized Merge Sort Algorithm to sort a list of digits and combine them into two numbers that would combine to the largest sum.  This mergeSort based algorithm would have an O(n log n) time complexity and a O(n) space complexity.

## Sort 012
Sorted an array with only three possible values in O(n) time and O(n) space complexity with an inplace sort.

## AutoComplete Trie
Built a Trie structure to hold words used to autocomplete words bassed on a prefix that would return all words as a list.  Space complexity is O(n * w) in the worst case where n is the number of letter and w is the number of words. The time complexity in this implemenation is O(n) where n is is the length of the word for finding inserting etc.

## Get Min and Max
A simple trasversal algorith to find the smallest and largest element utilizing O(n) time and O(1) space.

## Request Routing
Utilizing a Trie structure this class holds the folder structure and handlers(files) associated with a web server.  The algorithm calls have a O(n) time complexity and a O(n) space complexity.
